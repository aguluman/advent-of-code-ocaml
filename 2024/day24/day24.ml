(** {1 Day 24: Crossed Wires - Boolean Logic Gate Simulation}

    Solves Advent of Code 2024 Day 24 challenge about simulating boolean logic gates and
    fixing a wiring issue in an electronic circuit. The implementation handles both the
    circuit simulation and the diagnostic repair of mis-wired gates.
    
    {2 Problem details:}
    
    - {b Part 1:} Simulate a system of AND, OR, and XOR logic gates with their interconnections
      to calculate a final decimal number from binary outputs on z-wires
    - {b Part 2:} Identify and fix four pairs of gates whose output wires have been swapped,
      preventing the circuit from correctly performing binary addition
    
    {2 The solution implements:}
    
    - Circuit simulation engine that processes gates in the correct order based on
      input/output dependencies
    - Circuit verification system that validates whether the circuit correctly
      performs binary addition
    - Search algorithm that identifies the gate pairs with swapped outputs

(** Represents the different types of boolean logic gates supported by the circuit.

    The circuit simulation supports three fundamental boolean operations:
    - {b And} - outputs 1 if both inputs are 1, otherwise 0
    - {b Or} - outputs 1 if at least one input is 1, otherwise 0 
    - {b Xor} - outputs 1 if inputs differ, otherwise 0
*)

  | And
  | Or
  | Xor


(** Evaluates a boolean logic gate operation on two input values.

    Applies the specified logic operation (AND, OR, or XOR) to the two input values
    and returns the result. This function uses OCaml's bitwise operators to perform
    the boolean logic operations efficiently.
    
    The function implements the three fundamental boolean operations used in the circuit:
    
    - {b And} (land) - outputs 1 if both inputs are 1, otherwise 0
    - {b Or} (lor) - outputs 1 if at least one input is 1, otherwise 0
    - {b Xor} (lxor) - outputs 1 if inputs differ, otherwise 0
    
    The bitwise operators ensure that the function works correctly for boolean values 
    represented as integers.
    
    @param operation The logic operation to perform (And, Or, or Xor)
    @param a The first input value (0 or 1)
    @param b The second input value (0 or 1)
    @return The result of applying the specified logic operation to the two inputs (0 or 1)

(** Represents a logic gate in the circuit with its inputs, output, and operation type.

    Each gate has:
    - Two input wires identified by their string names
    - One output wire identified by its string name
    - An operation type (AND, OR, or XOR)
    
    Gates wait for both inputs to have values before producing an output.

(** Solves Part 1 by simulating the circuit and calculating the decimal value
    from the binary outputs on z-wires.
    
    This function processes the circuit simulation and then:
    
  - 1. Identifies all wires whose names start with "z"
  - 2. Orders them by numeric suffix (z00, z01, z02, etc.)
  - 3. Interprets them as a binary number with z00 as the least significant bit
  - 4. Converts the binary number to decimal

    (** Solves Part 2 by identifying the four pairs of gates whose output wires have been swapped.
  
      This function implements a search algorithm to find the four pairs of gates that,
      when their outputs are swapped, allow the circuit to correctly perform binary addition.
      The approach involves:
      
    - 1. Building a validation function that tests if a circuit performs addition correctly
    - 2. Detecting circuit structure patterns that should appear in a binary adder
    - 3. Searching through possible gate combinations to identify the swapped pairs
    - 4. Verifying the solution by checking that the circuit works for all valid inputs
      
      The search employs cycle detection and structural validation to efficiently
      identify the correct swaps without testing all possible combinations.
