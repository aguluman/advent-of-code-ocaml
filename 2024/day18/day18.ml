(** Day 18: RAM Run This module implements a solution to navigate through a
    corrupted memory space where bytes are falling and blocking paths. The
    challenge involves finding the shortest path through a grid and determining
    the first byte that makes the exit unreachable.

    The memory space is represented as a grid where:
    - (0,0) is the starting position (top-left corner)
    - (n,n) is the exit position (bottom-right corner)
    - Corrupted memory positions cannot be entered

    @see <https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/18> Problem Description *)

module PairMap = Map.Make (IntPair)

(** [create_memory_grid grid_size positions] creates a grid representation of
    memory space. The grid is a boolean matrix where true indicates corrupted
    memory (bytes that have fallen) and false indicates safe memory locations.

    @param grid_size Size of the grid (grid_size+1 x grid_size+1)
    @param positions List of (x,y) coordinates where bytes have fallen
    @return A boolean matrix where true indicates corrupted memory *)

(** [find_shortest_path grid_size positions] finds the shortest path from (0,0)
    to (grid_size,grid_size) through a memory space with corrupted positions.

    The function uses Breadth-First Search to find the shortest path: 1. Start
    at position (0,0) with distance 0 2. Explore adjacent positions in all four
    directions 3. For each reachable uncorrupted position, record distance 4.
    Continue until destination is reached or all reachable positions are
    explored

    @param grid_size Size of the memory grid (grid_size+1 x grid_size+1)
    @param positions List of (x,y) coordinates of corrupted memory
    @return Some distance if a path exists, None if destination is unreachable
    @raise Invalid_argument if grid parameters are invalid *)

(** [calculate_min_steps grid_size bytes positions] determines the minimum steps
    needed to reach the exit after a specific number of bytes have fallen.

(** [find_blocking_byte grid_size positions] finds the first byte that makes the
    exit unreachable from the starting position.

    The function uses binary search to efficiently find the precise byte: 1.
    Start with the full list of positions 2. Use binary search to narrow down
    the critical position 3. When found, return the exact byte coordinates

    @param grid_size Size of the memory grid (grid_size+1 x grid_size+1)

(** [parse_byte_positions input] parses the input string into a sequence of byte
    positions.
